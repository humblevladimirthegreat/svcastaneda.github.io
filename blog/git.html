    <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
    <p>
      Version control allows you to revert back to an old version of a file if needed (e.g. the changes made broke the program, the old version had a better runtime) or read why a certain change was made.
    </p>

    <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
    <p>
      Git records all changes made to a file when you commit staged files. You may access the file's change history later on if you wish to do so.

    <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
    <p>
      GitHub is widely used, allows you to access your code anytime and anywhere, easily collaborate with other people, and track issues. Plus it provides a nice viewing platform of everything.
