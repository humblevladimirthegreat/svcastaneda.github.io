<!--
    1)  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
        I found it to be super helpful because my partner (Alex) gave me feedback and asked questions, which helped me to make my wireframe layout to be clearer for others to understand.

    2)  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
        Wireframing helped me start building my template with a plan instead of just going in blindly.

    3)  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
        Simple and consistent. Simple pages are less distracting for users and don't overwhelm them with information. Simpleness also makes a website easier to navigate, which in turn makes the process of finding certain things quicker. Consistency is also key because otherwise, it would confuse the user if things were to move around (e.g. navigation bar is on top for the homepage, on the left for the blog, and a dropdown on the about me page).

    4)  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
        I learned about the nav tags. In the past, I've used single row tables to make navigation tabs.
