####What are the benefits of version control?
Version control allows you to revert back to an old version of a file if needed (e.g. the changes made broke the program, the old version had a better runtime, etc.). It also allows you to create different branches for things like new features so that you don't mess up the main files. You can later merge those branches with the master branch.

####How does git help you keep track of changes?
Git is a version control system (VCS) that records and keeps track of all changes made to a file every time you commit staged files. You may access the file's change history later on if you wish to do so (e.g. read why a certain change was made). By using git, you no longer have to keep copies of old files (e.g. Rough Draft #1, Rough Draft #2, Final), which saves up a lot of space.

####Why use GitHub to store your code?
GitHub is widely used and allows you to access your code anytime and anywhere, easily collaborate with other people (e.g. create and merge pull requests), fork a repository to make your own unique version, and track issues. Plus it provides a nice viewing platform of everything and they have an *amazing* logo.
