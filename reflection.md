####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned the differences between the three. Padding adds space between the content of an element and the edge. Borders add a line (solid, dotted, or dashed) right along the element's edge. Margins add space outside of the element.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned about how positioning works and how frustrating it can be to get something to be where you want it to be.

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I thought that all of the colors, sizing, borders, and shadows were easy. Floating was the tricky part because I had to use Chrome DevTools to find out with CSS element style attribute I needed to use.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that you can resize elements with CSS using pt, px, em, or %. pt and px are both fixed numbers, while em and % are both responsive.
